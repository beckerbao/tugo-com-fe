# Folder structure

The project is organized into the following top-level directories:

- `assets/` – static resources used by the pages.
  - `css/` – page-specific stylesheets.
  - `images/` – image assets.
  - `js/` – JavaScript helpers for interactive pages.
- `db/` – sample SQL scripts and UML diagrams.
- `helpers/` – PHP utilities for API calls, session handling, and common helpers.
- `html/` – standalone HTML documents such as specs or demo pages.
- `includes/` – shared PHP fragments like header, footer, navbar, and tracking scripts.
- `pages/` – application pages mapped to routes (home, login, profile, flash sale, etc.).

At the repository root, documentation and configuration files (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `REACT_REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TASKS.md`, `.htaccess`) provide development guidelines and setup details.
